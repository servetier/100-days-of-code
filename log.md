**Goal 1:** Create a simple Tribute Page. Users will be able to view folklore on Stag Beetles in a simple article format.
### Day 0: Saturday, April 1st, 2023.

**Today's Progress:** Defined my first goal, wrote the pseudocode, and finished the basic html.

**Notes:** Stag beetles are cool, so I wanna start with a tribute page to stag beetles. I decided to reuse an essay I wrote a while back on stag beetle folklore, and reformat it into an article. I was expecting to make more progress in the hour, but I spent a long time fiddling with the format, only to land on a rather basic one. Tomorrow, I would like to add images and additional CSS styling.
