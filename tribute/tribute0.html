            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Folklore of the Stag Beetle</h2>
                <p>In Europe, the stag beetle has long been associated with supernatural powers and magic. In some traditions, it was believed that these insects could transform into human form, and they were often considered omens of death and destruction. They were also said to summon thunderstorms and lightning.</p>
                <p>Stag beetles were often associated with the devil due to their horns. In Britain, they believed their antlers were used to carry burning coals, and would cause fires by bringing these coals into houses. Meanwhile, those of the New Forest called stag beetles the Devil's Imp. Believing they would ruin the corn harvest, these beetles were stoned on sight.</p>
                <p>Others held a different view. In Germany they were associated with Thor, god of thunder and protector of the harvest. By placing a stag beetle on your head, you would be protected from the evil eye and being struck by lightning. </p>
                <p>In many Native American cultures, the Stag beetle was a powerful protector who symbolizes strength and endurance. Its hard exoskeleton was said to be as strong as metal, and the large mandibles were claimed to be able to crunch through even the hardest of rocks. It was known for the incredible stamina it had, traveling long distances in search of food. It was even viewed as a messenger from the spirit world. Should one fly towards you, it meant good fortune was coming your way.</p>
                <p>Christianity says the stag beetle symbolizes Christ himself. The strength it wields was said to allow it to kill prey much bigger than itself, a symbol of Christ's own victory over death. The large antlers were a symbol of Christ's wisdom and authority, while the beetle itself was associated with new life and rebirth due to its ability to shed its exoskeleton, becoming a symbol of hope and renewal.</p>
                <p>In Celtic mythology, stag beetles symbolized strength, power, and virility. They were associated with the god Cernunnos, lord of the animals and patron god of hunters. He was depicted with antlers or horns, linking him to animals such as the stag, bull, and boar. Many Celtic jewelry or decorative objects depict the stag beetle, and this jewelry was often gifted to friends and loved ones as a good luck charm. </p>
                <p>In many African cultures, the stag beetle was used in ceremonies and rituals. The stag beetle is a popular motif in African art and architecture, and was frequently depicted on doorways. This was because stag beetles were considered a guardian of the home. They were thought to have potent healing abilities, thus being used in many traditional medicines. It was even believed to be capable of bringing rain.</p>
                <p>In Northern France, a stag beetle carried in the pocket would bring wealth and luck in the lottery. </p>
                <p>Romanian woman braided the horns of stag beetles into their hair to ward off the evil eye.</p>
                <p>In Japan, the beetle is known as kabutomushi. The beetle's larval stage can be found in rice fields feeding on crop-damaging pests. The beetle is associated with strength and power, and was often used as a motif in armor and weaponry. </p>
                <p>In China, the stag beetle is seen as a symbol of good luck and a bringer of good news. It is often given as a gift to newlyweds or newborn babies as a symbol of longevity, due to its long 7-year life span. </p>
                <p>Pliny the Elder wrote that hanging a stag beetle around a child's neck could prevent them from wetting the bed. He also recommended these beetles to ward off ague or tendon problems.</p>
                <p>An ancient Greek myth claimed that the musician Cerambus was once adored by nymphs for his beautiful songs. He was the first to play a seven-stringed lyre, an instrument said to resemble a stag beetle's antlers. However, he grew arrogant and insulted his adoring fans, and was thus turned into a 'lowly' stag beetle as a punishment. For that reason, children in ancienct Greece would sometimes play by catching an unlucky stag beetle and shave off their heads to imitate Cerambus' seven-stringed lyre. </p>
